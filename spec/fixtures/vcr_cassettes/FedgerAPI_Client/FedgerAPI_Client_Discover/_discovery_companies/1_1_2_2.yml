        Danger), Rich Miner (co-founder of Wildfire), Nick Sears (once VP at T-Mobile),
        and Chris White (one of the first engineers at WebTV). At the time, little
        was known about the functions of Android other than they made software for
        mobile phones. This began rumors that Google was planning to enter the mobile
        phone market, although it was unclear at the time what function they might
        perform in that market. Android has a large community of developers writing
        applications (''apps'') that extend the functionality of the devices. There
        are currently over 200,000 apps available for Android. Android Market is the
        online app store run by Google, though apps can also be downloaded from third-party
        sites. Developers write primarily in the Java language, controlling the device
        via Google-developed Java libraries. The unveiling of the Android distribution
        on 5 November 2007 was announced with the founding of the Open Handset Alliance,
        a consortium of 80 hardware, software, and telecom companies devoted to advancing
        open standards for mobile devices. Google released most of the Android code
        under the Apache License, a free software and open source license. The Android
        open-source software stack consists of Java applications running on a Java-based,
        object-oriented application framework on top of Java core libraries running
        on a Dalvik virtual machine featuring JIT compilation. Libraries written in
        C include the surface manager, OpenCore media framework, SQLite relational
        database management system, OpenGL ES 2.0 3D graphics API, WebKit layout engine,
        SGL graphics engine, SSL, and Bionic libc. The Android operating system, including
        the Linux kernel, consists of roughly 12 million lines of code including 3
